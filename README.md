# Trappist-1
### A simulation of our new favorite *possibly inhabitable* starsystem

Made with p5.js

This project was completed as part of [DadaGeek's](http://www.dadageek.com/) p5 class taught by [@jromeem](https://github.com/jromeem)

Project is deployed at [http://cji-trappist.surge.sh](http://cji-trappist.surge.sh). By switching the view to "solar system" and zooming out, the user can see a relative size and speed comparison of our system's planets compared to Trappist-1.  Planet orbits and speed are scaled from their actual values. Try clicking anywhere on the screen for a fun comet animation!
