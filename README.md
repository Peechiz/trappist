# Trappist-1
### A simulation of our new favorite *possibly inhabitable* starsystem written with P5.js

This project was completed as part of a class on [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) presented by [DadaGeek](http://www.dadageek.com/) and taught by [@jromeem](https://github.com/jromeem)

Project is deployed at [http://cji-trappist.surge.sh](http://cji-trappist.surge.sh). By switching the view to "solar system" and zooming out, the user can see a relative size and speed comparison of our system's planets compared to Trappist-1.  Planet orbits and speed are scaled from their actual values. Try clicking anywhere on the screen for a fun comet animation!
